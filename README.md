 The Orphan Welfare & Care Coordination Web App is designed to help orphanage and welfare community members identify, record, and support homeless children and elderly people who need care. The application allows members to collect important details such as personal information, location, and type of assistance required, making it easier to organize and provide timely help.By centralizing welfare-related information in one place, the project improves coordination among volunteers and helps in planning essential services like food distribution, shelter assistance, and medical support. The main aim of this project is to promote social responsibility and provide a structured approach to community service activities.
